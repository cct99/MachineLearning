# Machine Learning Algorithms

This project is a collection of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms included are

Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
K-Means clustering
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script that can be run from the command line. But it is best to run in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
