# Machine Learning Algorithms

This project is a collection of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms included are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, FNN,  and K-Means.
Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script that can be run from the command line. But it is best to run in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
